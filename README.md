Notebook best viewed in Google Collab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Ruchita1003/Analyzing-OTT-Platforms/blob/main/Analyzing_OTT_Platforms.ipynb)<br>

### Steps to run the project:
- Open the notebook in colab.
- Add the articles.csv to the data folder inside the colab.
- Select 'Run All' to run the entire notebook at once.

## Problem Domain:

### The primary domain that we identify here is ***Media Analytics***. To narrow it down further, we are concentrating more on ***user engagement***  of the news wing of media.


### 1. Unveiling Reader Engagement Behaviour using Supervised Learning:

- We want to be able to predict whether an article will feature as a "Top Article" or not. It is vital for any publication agency to understand the reach of any article in the pipline. This assists the publication house in strategic allocation of their resources among all the articles in the pipline.                  

- Our project also aims at predicting the "Popularity Score" and the "Enagagement Count" of an article. The goal underneath this is to be able to understand and foretell users/readers engagement behaviour with the article. We wish to speculate the number of likes, shares, comments and reactions on a article before it is released as these are some of the primary popularity/engagement driving parameters. Our model will be able to help an author/publication get insights for a particular article which "headline" or what "content" will garner the most enagagement.

- We are also keen on exploring whether we can let agencies know which release time is the best for maximum user engagement. For example, BBC News would love to know what is the best time of the day for them to release an article belonging to Sports domain in order to maximize user enagegement.

### 2. Understanding the influence of certain keywords on an article's popularity using Unsupervised Learning:
- Our team is also inclined towards performing topic modeling to understand the underlying topic pool of all articles. This will help us categorize articles to domains they belong to. For example Politics, Crime, Hollywood, Sports etc. (Currently our dataset does not contain this). If possible we would like to extend our idea into understanding which keywords have a strong positive effect on the article's popularity/engagement. A practical use case of this could be as follows ~ we will help The New Yorker know usage of which keywords in a sports article will most likely boost reader engagement.

### 3. Analyze if an article is polarizing
- If the article is polarizing and has been receiving a lot of engagement, this article and the author gets flagged. The agency and Government can then monitor these authors to ensure they are not trigerring riots and other public disturbances
- We can see that Polarizing content garners a lot of views, which is problematic
